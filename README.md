# HLP Brute Force
An optimized brute force program created to find solutions for the Hex Layer Problem.

## The Hex Layer Problem
*What is the Hex Layer Problem anyway?*

The short explanation is that the problem asks the following:

Given a target sequence, find the optimal (shortest) function of layers which reaches it.

"Reaching" a target sequence just means treating the sequence as a function (index = input) would have the same funcitonality as the layer-composed function.

Now for a longer explanation.
